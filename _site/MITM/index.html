<h2>🕵️ In-Depth Case File</h2>
<p>Murder in the Mansion isn't just a game.... it's a mental chess match against the killer, the clock, and even time itself.</p>
<p>You play as a seasoned detective, called to the lavish estate of John Wallace, a business mogul found dead in his home office in the early hours of March 13th. On the surface, it’s a straightforward case. But from the moment you arrive, you realize: something doesn’t add up.</p>
<h3>🧠 Gameplay Flow</h3>
<ul>
<li>Begin in a <strong>classic detective interface</strong>: moody music, static imagery, and a minimalist start menu featuring a family portrait of John, his wife Emily, and their son Alex.</li>
<li>You’re greeted by on-scene officers who debrief you on what they know so far and more importantly, what they don’t know.</li>
<li>A mysterious <strong>bulletin board icon</strong> appears. This is your access point to the evidence board: photos, receipts, sticky notes, text threads, call logs, and much more.</li>
</ul>
<p>This evidence board becomes your hub. Clues update in real-time, and more evidence items appear as you interrogate suspects and dig deeper into the timeline. Events get triggered based on the amount of evidence files you've looked at. So make sure you look at all the evidence!</p>
<h3>🔍 Tools at Your Disposal</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>EVIDENCE BOARD</strong>: Central hub where all clues are stored. Updated dynamically after key actions.</li>
<li><strong>INTERROGATION INTERFACE</strong>: Unlock and revisit suspect interrogations based on your findings.</li>
<li><strong>CLUE RECONSTRUCTION</strong>: Some evidence links together. The players must make logical connections.</li>
<li><strong>ARREST WARRANT SUBMISSION</strong>: Choose when you're ready to accuse. But beware — once submitted, the game locks in your decision.</li>
<li><strong>HELP SCREEN</strong>: A dedicated guide built right into the game. It outlines key mechanics, controls, and a few foundational investigation tips.</li>
<li><strong>TIPS FEATURE</strong>: You can reveal up to two high-impact investigation tips. These aren’t throwaway hints, so only use them if you HAVE to.</li>
</ul>
<h3>🎭 Endgame &amp; Consequences</h3>
<p>Once you submit your warrant, the tone shifts dramatically.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nerve-wracking final sequence</strong>: A heartbeat quickens. Strobe effects flash. Cryptic messages flicker across the screen.</li>
<li>This is where the game changes based on if you're right or if you're wrong.</li>
<li>Those detectives who were paying ATTENTION and figured out the truth will get a MUCH different experience than those who were wrong.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of outcome, you'll be shown a <strong>full case debrief</strong> explaining the truth, the false trails, and the exact evidence that sealed the killer’s fate.</p>
