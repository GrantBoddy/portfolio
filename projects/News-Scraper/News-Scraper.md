## How It Works

1. **Launch the CLI**  
   The program greets you with custom ASCII wolf art and a menu.  
2. **Automated Scraping**  
   Uses Playwright to launch a browser, paginate through Hacker News, and collect 100 articles.
3. **Sorting Validation**  
   Parses timestamps and checks if the articles are sorted from newest to oldest.
4. **Stats & Analysis**  
   - Normal Mode: Presents clean stats (article counts, domain diversity, busiest posting times, etc.)
   - Fun Mode: Adds playful metrics (clickbaitiest headline, domain oddities, and more)
5. **Export & Visualize**  
   - Export results as CSV/JSON
   - Launch a local server to view interactive charts (React + Vite frontend)
   - Open raw results in your browser
6. **All from the Terminal**  
   Every feature is accessible from a single, interactive terminal menu.
